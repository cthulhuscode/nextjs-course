# Custom App (`_app.tsx`)

It's a special file that acts as the entry point for your application. It is responsible for initializing pages, layouts, and other shared components.

Next.js uses the `App` component to initialize pages. You can override it and control the page initialization and:

- Persist layouts between page changes
- Keeping state when navigating pages: Context/Providers, theme, data...
- Inject additional data into pages
- Add global CSS

To override the default App, create the file `pages/_app.js` as shown below:

    export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
        return <Component {...pageProps} />;
    }

The `Component` prop is the active `page`, so whenever you navigate between routes, `Component` will change to the new `page`. Therefore, any props you send to `Component` will be received by the `page`.

`pageProps` is an object with the initial props that were preloaded for your page by one of our `_data fetching methods_`, otherwise it's an empty object.
