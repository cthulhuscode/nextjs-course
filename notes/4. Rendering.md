# Rendering

Pre-rendering is an important feature of Next.js that improves performance and enables **search engine optimization (SEO)** by generating HTML pages in advance.

Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating static HTML files for your application's pages before they are served to the client. There are two types of pre-rendering in Next.js: **static pre-rendering** and **server-side rendering (SSR)**.

- **Static pre-rendering (Static Generation or "SSG")**: Static pre-rendering generates HTML pages at build time, which means that the pages are generated once during the build process and then served as static files to the clients. This approach is suitable for pages that do not require frequent data updates and can be cached for faster subsequent requests. When a user requests a pre-rendered page, the server serves the static HTML directly, without executing any JavaScript code on the client-side.

  Static pre-rendering is beneficial for performance because it allows the content to be served from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) rather than generating it on each request. It provides fast initial page loads and good SEO, as search engines can easily index the static HTML pages. Next.js provides a data fetching method, `getStaticProps`, which allows you to fetch data at build time and include it in the pre-rendered page.

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)**: Server-side rendering generates HTML pages on each request. When a user visits a page, the server runs the necessary JavaScript code to render the page on the server and sends the generated HTML to the client. This approach is useful for pages that require real-time or dynamic data that can change with each request.

  SSR is helpful when you have pages with content that frequently updates or relies on user-specific data. Next.js provides a data fetching method, `getServerSideProps`, which allows you to fetch data on each request and include it in the server-rendered page.

Both static pre-rendering and server-side rendering have their use cases, and Next.js allows you to choose the appropriate rendering method for each page based on your requirements. **By default, Next.js uses static pre-rendering (SSG) for pages**, but you can opt for server-side rendering (SSR) when needed.

It's worth mentioning that Next.js also supports **client-side rendering (CSR)** for components or parts of your application that require interactivity or real-time updates.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Allows you to create or update static pages after you’ve built your site. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.

When a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.

- Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.
- After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page
- Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.
- Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.
- When a request is made to a path that hasn’t been generated, Next.js will server-render the page on the first request. Future requests will serve the static file from the cache.
