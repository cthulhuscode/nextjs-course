# Prefetching

Prefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before it's visited. The rendered result of prefetched routes is added to the router's client-side cache. This makes navigating to a prefetched route near-instant.

By default, routes are prefetched as they become visible in the viewport when using the ``<Link>`` component. This can happen when the page first loads or through scrolling. Routes can also be programmatically ``prefetched`` using the prefetch method of the ``useRouter()`` hook.

**Static and Dynamic Routes**:

- If the route is static, all the Server Component payloads for the route segments will be prefetched.
- If the route is dynamic, the payload from the first shared layout down until the first ``loading.js`` file is prefetched. This reduces the cost of prefetching the whole route dynamically and allows instant loading states for dynamic routes.

**Good to know:**
- Prefetching is only enabled in production.
- Prefetching can be disabled by passing prefetch={false} to <Link>.
