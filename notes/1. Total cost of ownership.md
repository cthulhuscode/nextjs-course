# Total cost of ownership

The Cost of Ownership in software engineering refers to the total expenses involved in owning and operating software throughout its lifecycle. It includes development costs (hiring developers, acquiring tools), infrastructure costs (hardware, software licenses), maintenance and support costs (bug fixes, updates), training and documentation costs, integration costs, upgrades and migration costs, and security and compliance costs. The specific expenses can vary depending on factors such as project size, complexity, and technology used. Understanding the Cost of Ownership helps in making informed decisions about software investments.
