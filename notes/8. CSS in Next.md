# CSS in Next.js

Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:

- **Global CSS**: Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.

  Global styles can be imported in the `./pages/_app.ts` file.

- **CSS Modules**: Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.

      import styles from "./navbar.module.css";

      export const Navbar = () => {
        return (
          <nav className={styles.nav}>

          </nav>
        );
      };

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.
- **Sass**: A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
- **CSS-in-JS**: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.

      const Products = () => {

        return (
          <div className="products">

            {/* ... */}

            <style jsx>{`
              .products {
                margin-top: 20px;

                display: flex;
                flex-direction: column;
                align-items: center;
                gap: 40px;
              }
            `}</style>
          </div>
        );
      };

export default Products;
