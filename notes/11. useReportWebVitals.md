# `useReportWebVitals`

It's a function that allows you to measure and report various web vitals metrics for your application. It's typically used in the `_app.tsx` file.

By implementing `reportWebVitals`, you can collect and report important metrics such as:

**Time To First Byte (TTFB)**: This metric measures the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of the response from the server after making a request. It represents the server's responsiveness and network latency. A lower TTFB indicates faster server response times.

**First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: FCP measures the time it takes for the browser to render the first piece of content on the screen. It could be text, an image, or any other visible element. FCP helps evaluate how quickly users perceive that the page is loading.

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: LCP measures the time it takes for the largest visible content element (such as an image or a block-level text) to render within the viewport. LCP gives insights into the perceived load speed and how quickly the main content becomes visible to the user.

**First Input Delay (FID)**: FID measures the time between the user's first interaction (like clicking a button or tapping a link) and the browser's response to that interaction. It quantifies the interactivity of the page and indicates how responsive it is to user input. A lower FID value indicates better responsiveness.

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: CLS measures the sum of all individual layout shift scores that occur during the entire lifespan of a page. Layout shifts occur when visible elements on the page move unexpectedly, causing content to shift and potentially leading to a poor user experience. CLS quantifies the visual stability of the page, with a lower CLS indicating fewer layout shifts.
